I am under constant attack from distractions. Slack messages, meetings, emails, notifications; if I manage to shut those out my own mind becomes the enemy. "Could I 3d print a boat?", "What's the average distance between galaxies?", "Remember that time you said that embarrassing thing to Tony Stephenson? I bet that guy thinks you're an asshole".

- I get distracted (so do you!)
- I need to get shit done
- I need to constantly learn new things
- The real cost of distracting thoughts is the number of times you repeat them
- Some thoughts pop up because they're important (check of some new technology)
- I need to be able to:
    - Deal with unavoidable distractions and step STRAIGHT back into where I was when I'm done
    - Expunge useless distractions
