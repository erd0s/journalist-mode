I am under constant attack from distractions. Slack messages, meetings, emails, notifications; if I manage to shut those out my own mind becomes the enemy. "Could I 3d print a boat?", "What's the average distance between galaxies?", "Remember that embarrassing thing you did that time?".

Not all distractions are bad though. When you come across an unfamiliar word while reading a book, you stop to look it up in a dictionary, and if the definition itself contains an unknown word, you look that one up as well.

To translate the analogy to a day at work, I might be in the middle of reviewing a new AWS service, get a call about a serious bug in production and need to help someone debug it, to debug it I need to read some code, the code uses an API that I've never seen and I need to read some documentation.

At each point I need to make a decision whether to dive deeper into the rabbit-hole, but most importantly I leave a breadcrumb trail of thoughts so I can find my way back up the rabbit-hole once I've completed a subtask. It's a terrible waste to forget about the AWS service I was reviewing and come back to it a few weeks later because I'll need to start my research from scratch, I've lost the context from the other day.

The distractions above are unavoidable, but for the avoidable distractions I want to waste as little time thinking about them as possible. If a useless thought pops into my head I try to obverse that it's there, write it down in a list of distractions and move on. If the same thought pops up again I put a dot next to it in my list. If I actively observe these thoughts it takes at most 2 or 3 dots before they're completely gone from my brain.

For the useful but avoidable distractions, like "I need to renew my visa", they either go into my todo list, or if they're short enough and important enough I put them on top of my "doing" stack and just get them out of the way.

So my day ends up looking something like this:
